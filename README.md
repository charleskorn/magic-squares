# magic-squares

The fourth Shokunin challenge:

> With a positive integer x as input, build and print the magic square of order x
> (hence all the numbers from 1 to xÂ² in a grid with equal sums horizontally, vertically and diagonally).

There's more information about magic squares on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square).
